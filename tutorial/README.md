# wnstatmech_tutorial

This Jupyter notebook illustrates the usage of the *wnstatmech* package. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  If you receive a warning about the authorship of the notebook, you may ignore it by clicking on Run anyway.  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu.  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.

It is also possible to run the notebook on [Binder](https://mybinder.org).  To do so, click on the launch binder badge at the end of this paragraph.  It will take a few minutes to build the appropriate environment, but once done, you can click on the *wnstatmech_tutorial.ipynb* notebook in the *tutorial* folder to launch it.

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download the linked notebook above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook wnstatmech_tutorial.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on the notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.
